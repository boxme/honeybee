# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Honeybee is a minimal repository with only a basic README.md file. The project appears to be in its initial setup phase with no established codebase, dependencies, or build system yet.

## Current State

- Repository contains only a README.md with the project name "Honeybee"
- No package.json, requirements.txt, or other dependency management files
- No source code files present
- No build, test, or development commands available
- No established architecture or project structure

## Development Guidance

Since this is a new/empty repository, development commands and architecture will need to be established as the project grows. When code is added, this file should be updated to include:

- Build and development commands
- Testing procedures
- Project architecture and structure
- Any specific conventions or patterns adopted

## Notes

This repository is in its initial state. Future updates to this file will be needed as the project structure and tooling are established.
